# LiveShare
 
Please remember to make new folder, js, css and html files for each new task.
If you don't remember this, it's going to be looking like a huge mess! D:

Images can be stored in the images folder in the root directory, but also in the respective folder for each LiveShare tasks.

We don't want too much css and js in the html file itself, only if needed or for testing.
